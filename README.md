# Swarm-Robotics
Pattern formation in a swarm of self assembling robots using master slave algorithm
This project aims to envision a robot system that can be operated by two or more robots using a master save algorithm. Master slave is a technique that can be implemented in the field of swarm robotics. Swarm robotics is an emerging field of Artificial Intelligence and robotics and in theory can be used in multiple fields ranging from disaster relief work to space exploration.
